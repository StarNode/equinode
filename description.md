### Sottotitolo
Equilibrio, inclinazione e controllo 

Balance, tilt and control, uncover sound and shine a light on the hidden. Step onto the platform and find your point of balance; your state of equilibrium.

### Description
*equinode* fuses interactive light projections and algorithmically generated music to create an immersive audience experience. Visitors uncover streams of music and manipulate the spectrum of light by stepping onto the platform and finding a point of balance and equilibrium: an *equinode*. Sensors hidden in the platform detect the slightest movements made by whoever steps onto it. Musical gestures, the mix of the music and the light projections change in response to these audience interactions. The dynamic environment becomes a challenge to find points of clarity, where cacophonous sounds and jittery lighting can be controlled. Four streams of music (drums, bass, rhythm and lead) are mapped to the colours of the spectrum. The sound-light mappings are exposed through  audience interaction, focusing and fixing the sonic and visual elements for a point in time.

The project is realised using wireless technologies, open-source software and embedded computer systems. Source code can be found at www.github.com/starnode/equinode.
