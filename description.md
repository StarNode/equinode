Author: Star Node  (Main Authors: Balandino Di Donato, James Dooley, Guido Iommarini)

Star Node is a multidisciplinary group of artists. The Node of music, visual arts, computer science, engineering, biology and human-computer interactivity dislocated between Italy and United Kingdom, it is the strength  of the Star Node group.

The group recently formed, is composed by Maurizio Di Berardino, Balandino Di Donato, James Dooley, Riccardo La Chioma, Guido Iommarini, Flavia Massimo, Luana Fiorella Mincarelli, Cristian Paolucci. 

Their main focus on sound-art installations come from the necessity of expressing their artistic ideas through an immersive audience experience, empowering themselves to interact and so to establish the evolution of the artwork itself.

The main authors of "equinode" are Balandino Di Donato and James Dooley.

###Balandino Di Donato
Balandino Di Donato is a PhD student at the Integra Lab (Birmingham City Univeristy), which research is focused on live sound spatialisation using gestural controller. 

Previously, he has been working for Centro Ricerche Musicali di Roma, where he has been involved in sound art installations realised by Michelangelo Lupone and Licia Galizia in Italy, Peru, Egypt and Turkey over the period 2009-2013. Afterwards his graduation at A.Casella Conservatoire, with a thesis regarding the use and development of application for the Tangible User Interface Metis, Balandino moved to Birmingham to join the Integra Lab for the development of Integra Live, where later on he gained a position as PhD Student.

### James Dooley ###

James Dooley is a digital artist and creative coder based in Birmingham, UK. James’ performance and installation works use sound to create a sense of place — a meta-environment — to transform existing spaces. Influenced by complexity science, his works rely on the interactions between many simple and autonomous elements that coalesce to produce emergent forms that slowly evolve over time.

##Catch Line
Balance, tilt and control, uncover sound and shine a light on the hidden. Step onto the platform and find your point of balance; your state of equilibrium.

## Description
*equinode* fuses interactive light projections and algorithmically generated music to create an immersive audience experience. 

Visitors uncover streams of music and manipulate the spectrum of light by stepping onto the platform and finding a point of balance and equilibrium: an *equinode*. Sensors hidden in the platform detect the slightest movements made by whoever steps onto it. 
Musical gestures, the mix of the music and the light projections change in response to these audience interactions. 

The dynamic environment becomes a challenge to find points of clarity, where cacophonous sounds and jittery lighting can be controlled. Four streams of music (drums, bass, rhythm and lead) are mapped to the colours of the spectrum. The sound-light mappings are exposed through  audience interaction, focusing and fixing the sonic and visual elements for a point in time.

The project is realised using wireless technologies, open-source software and embedded computer systems. Source code can be found at www.github.com/starnode/equinode.
